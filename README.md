# Blocky-Chase

![](blockychase.png)

This is the code for https://3d-epicycles.ashayp.com/. 

I created this website because I wanted to extend the [Fourier Epicycle examples](https://www.myfourierepicycles.com/) that I saw online to **3 Dimensions.** Now, you can draw any 3D object using a bunch of rotating circles in a matter of seconds!

### Functionality

- Draw a variety of 3D objects, from simple cubes and cones to complex goldfish, ice cream cones, and dragons.
- Move around/zoom in the 3D space using your mouse and keyboard.
- A brief explanation on how the website was created using the Discrete Fourier Transform and Epicycles.
